      <h3>Basic offroad training, Austria</h3>
      <p>
        Black ice, emergency stops or sudden evasive manoeuvres on slick roads – we will prepare you for the chilly
        season in a fantastic Alpine setting. What do you do when your car starts to skid? What’s the right way to brake
        on icy roads? Learn to keep a cool head and to control your vehicle confidently even in surprising situations on
        the 120,000-square-meter ice arena in the Austrian driving training centre in Saalfelden.
